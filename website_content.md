We offer a whole host of services which our handyman carries out in a prompt, reliable and professional manner. From cat flaps to flat screen tv wall mounting and flat packs to a bath reseal. All work is guaranteedHandyman Manchester is a family run buisness and all our handyman are fully qualified and time served tradesman. We take pride in our work! All our company vehicles are fully sign written so your mind is put at ease as soon as we arrive as we dont work out of car boots!
Handyman in Manchester covers the whole of the Greater Manchester area.We have worked as far north as Bury and Bolton down to Stockport and below. We pride ourselves on being prompt and reliable and making sure all of our customers are 100% satisfied with the work we do for them. Handyman Manchester is experienced in most trades and is confident you will be pleased with the result. If you job is too big or requires the attention of a Gas Safe approved plumber or NICEIC electrician we will let you know as we won’t do any work we are not qualified to do.
As most of our work comes from repeat custom, word of mouth and referrals this means we don’t have to spend much money putting adverts in newspapers and local magazines. As we don’t incur these costs this means we can pass the savings onto the customer meaning you not only get a great service and end result but also it doesn’t cost you that much really. All we ask is that if you are happy with our handyman service and expertise then you recommend us to a friend, this way it keeps our advertising cost down, as well as our prices.
Your handyman will be happy to quote on any jobs you want doing and will be happy to provide this as fixed-fee, anywhere across the whole ofGreater Manchester.This means it is not an estimate or a guess at the price which will then grow from all the add-ons and extras. What it means is the price you see before we start the work is the price you pay when we finish the work. This way you won’t be hit with any nasty extras or unforseen add-ons.
Whatever jobs you’ve been meaning to get round, but haven’t completed yet then our Manchester Handyman is there to help. We’ll get all the unfinshed jobs finished for you at a price you can afford and a service you can’t beat.
We get lots of phone calls from people looking for a handyman about what jobs we are able to do, if we are able to fix a particular item or complete a particular project. So we thought we would list a range of jobs that we have carried out for customers throughout the county and show how diverse and adaptable Manchester Handyman is:
We have repaired, filled and painted both internal and external window frames as well as replacing panes of glass and double glazed units. Installed skirting boards, laminate flooring, door frames and doors, added door handles and locks and then undercoated and glossed them. We have worked out side clearing and tidying gardens and yards before cutting the lawn, trimming hedges and bushes and power washing driveways and paths, we have also creosoted fences and painted outdoor doors and woodwork such as shed and garages.
Inside houses we have replaced kitchen worktops, cupboards, refitted whole kitchens, added new cupboards or just replaced doors. Our Handyman Manchester team has also fitted lino, tiled floors and walls, fitted new taps and put up cooker hoods. Although we are not professional painters and decorators we are able to strip wallpaper, sand down and prepare woodwork and then emulsion walls and gloss the woodwork. Some people like this option as it mostly works out cheaper than employing a professional decorator with very similar results. If you are looking for complex finishes or complex wallpaper putting up then Manchester Handyman would be happy to recommend someone.
In bathrooms in Manchester we have taken out old bath suites, tiled bathrooms, put up towel rails, mirrors and mirrors. We have also put up and installed self assembly bathroom and bedroom furniture such as cupboards, wardrobes, desks, drawers, bunk beds, TV stands and installed a few plasma and lcd TVs onto brackets on walls and chimneys.
Our Manchester based handyman services also stretch much wider and cover a lot more home repairs and work. If you have some repair jobs in mind but are not sure if it is something we do then pick up the phone and we will let you know.

Prices & Costs -
Source: https://www.handyman-manchester.net/prices-costs/
All of our jobs are priced up on a fixed-fee basis so we’ll pop round to have a look what the job entails and then tell you how much it will cost. Not how much it might cost or a rough idea but the exact cost for doing the job. As you can understand this means we need to see the job before we can give you a price but as a rough guide we have put down some prices below.
With handyman manchesteryou know the total cost before we startplus you only pay when the job is complete and you are happy with the result.
Our Handyman will give you a quote on any work you want us to do and the more work you give us the more discount we will give you. If you want to arrange a quote or ask us if we are interested in doing a job for you then please give us a call and we will pop round whenever is next convenient for you.
If you want to pay as little as possible when employing the services of a handyman then there are a few things you can do yourself to help keep the costs down and stick to your budget.
Tidy Up –If we are resealing a shower tray it helps if the shower cubicle is clear of shampoo bottles, bars of soap, razors and hair before we start. Clearing up, then cleaning then drying the area can take quite a while. This is time you can save the handyman by doing it yourself.
Organise –If you want our Manchester handyman to paint one of your rooms, it take less time if the furniture is dragged to the centre of the room ready to be covered in sheeting and the woodwork is wiped down with a damp cloth. We don’t mind doing this ourselves but it is things you could do to save a bit of cash.
Refer a friend– Recommending us to your friends and family in Greater Manchester and supplying us with extra work really keeps down our advertising costs. This means we can give you a discount on future work we do for you

Excellent service!! Rang Manchester Handyman to enquire if he would travel to my area and he was on his way to my house within the hour. I was worried about the type of door and glass in which the cat flap was to be fitted into. It was Georgian Wired Glass and a local glaziers I had called previously for a quote did not sound confident to do it at all. I also called other cat flap fitting companys and i seemed to be greated by people who just didnt know what they were talking about… No problems however for Manchester handyman. Twenty minutes later and I had a beautifully fitted cat flap!! No stress whatsoever and so nice to have such a pleasant one to one service. If anyone needs a cat flap fitted, Mark at Manchester handyman is your man
Good luck with your business Mark – I am very impressed and grateful. Hope this helps, especially if anyone else lives in an old style 70’s house with original  features and fittings!!
Kind regards

Plastering Services -
Source: https://www.handyman-manchester.net/services/plastering-services-in-manchester/
Examples of our workPlanning on building an outside wall? Need a ceiling resurfaced? Our plastering team offer a range of services to fulfil your plastering requirements.
Our team are fully qualifiedand highly skilled within all plastering aspects i.e. of solid, wet plastering, dry wall system.Using our tried and tested specialist techniques, we can transform otherwise ordinary rooms into timeless places of elegance and sophistication.
In addition to plastering work, we can repair and replace damaged ceilings, plaster over artex, handle wall skimming and we can work both indoors and outdoors.
All Manchester Handyman work is fully insured and guaranteed by our trained experts and we are always on hand to answer any queries you may have and carry out assignments to the highest standard possible.
Solid plastering– Solid Plastering is the application of wet finishes to internal walls, floors and ceilings. It also includes applying protective covering to external walls such as pebble dashing. We can handle all aspects of plasterwork, including walls, fittings and even ornamental decorative displays, whatever your requirement. Any size and shape surface can be plastered, and all jobs are carried out to your exact specification.<br>
Exterior and interior rendering– Applying the plaster to brickwork and other such surfaces, we can plaster both internally and sand finish buildings externally. Stucco plastering work can be trowelled or made by hand, depending upon individual needs, and can be applied to imitate stonework or pebble dashed for an appealing look.
Venetian plastering– There are a number of different methods we can use in the creation of Venetian plaster, all depending upon your exact requirements. Adding a Venetian plaster surface to a room adds a touch of class that is both unique and timeless in its appeal, and all of our plasterers are fully trained in the art form.
Dry lining– A faster and easier alternative to solid plastering, dry lining involves plasterboard that is applied to the wall and then smoothed to finish. A cheaper substitute to plastering, also tends to dry faster than more traditional techniques allowing you to carry on with the decorating far quicker than you would otherwise be able to.All of our services are completely time-managed, with no hidden costs or charges and are competitively priced.

Painting and decorating any room can give a complete change of mood. It can create many different looks and change how the room makes you feel. The choice of colour can determine your attitude and give the impression of a larger or smaller space. This is all well and good, but there may be a few underlying issues which you haven’t yet thought about, which maybe you should.
We have been decorating for many years and we see the same thing repeating itself with many decorating jobs. Sometimes you want to change more than just painting and decorating. This is handyman manchesters realm….

Hello and welcome to our painting and decorating services section! Now we shall assume that you are here because you have either bought a brand spanking new house that you want decorating, that you’ve suddenly realised that your home was outdated 25 years ago and desperately needs a decoration overhaul or you’ve a huge commercial office that needs a spruce up to get it looking dapper? Well you’re in luck because we just happen to be one of the best (probably!) painters and decorators in the Manchester area – not that we’re fond of blowing our own trumpet! We can tackle any decorating job you care to throw at us; from livening up small family homes to large city centre offices. No commercial or domestic painting and decorating job is too big or too large for our team of super decorators!
We operate in and around the Manchester area, so if you live a little further out just give us a call and we’ll do our best to get to you. Our reputation is growing fast within the Greater Manchester area so we are used to travelling a little further afield for clients!
Not only are we friendly and helpful, but we have years of experience and offer a professional, guaranteed, top notch service that you’ll be recommending to friends and family. In fact it’s through recommendations that we get most of our business, which says a lot about the type of decorating service we offer.
So what will we do? Well really you should be asking what we don’t do! Here are just a few of the services we cover:
Our creative streak means that we take a real pride in our work and can offer you advice and inspiration on themes and decor for your home. Our painters are artists when it comes to feature walls and can create children’s room themes, wall characters and stunning designs that will bring your room to life!
One thing we won’t do is to charge you for any advice, consultation or estimates. We understand that deciding on the right decor for your home takes time and so we are more than happy to leave the information with you and give you time to plan your dream home or office.
If you have a job that requires plastering and are looking for a professional plasterer, then see ourPlastering Page.
What also comes as standard with us are:
We don’t just want to provide an adequate painting and decorating service, we want to go above and beyond your expectations – after all our business depends on recommendations from happy customers! Our professionalism shines through everything we do, from the day we enter until the day we leave.
For our commercial clients we understand the need for minimal disruption to the workplace, so our workers will aim to get the job done as quickly as possible at times to suit you and wherever possible we will adhere to any deadlines.
So why not give us a call now and find out what we can do for you! Or take a look at our sister company…. just type manchesterdecorating.co.uk!

Well, we’ve always offered it, but thought it was about time we put it on our website.
Handyman Manchester now offersTV Wall Mountinganywhere in the Greater Manchester area.
We thought with Christmas rapidly approaching and TVs being quite a popular present that we would let everyone we know we are able to wall mount any size or brand of television on most types of wall, whether brick, block or stud.
Book us in today and we’ll make sure you don’t miss out on your festive viewing.
Have a great Christmas

Well, we’ve always offered it, but thought it was about time we put it on our website.
Handyman Manchester now offersTV Wall Mountinganywhere in the Greater Manchester area.
We thought with Christmas rapidly approaching and TVs being quite a popular present that we would let everyone we know we are able to wall mount any size or brand of television on most types of wall, whether brick, block or stud.
Book us in today and we’ll make sure you don’t miss out on your festive viewing.
Have a great Christmas

Handyman Services|Permalink|Comments Offon Expanding from North Manchester|  Posted April 30, 2010 by  admin
We touch on this in ourHandyman Chargespage but though we would expand a little bit here.
We get asked to look at handyman jobs across a lot of the North West aswell as just Manchester. No matter where abouts we go, whether it be to people’s homes or offices we always meet people, probably a couple of times a month, who we know could save money on a handyman.
The reason they could save money is they are using alot of the Handyman’s time on wasteful tasks, i’ll list some below to try and help people who would like to save a bit of cash.
Know what you want doing (or at least an idea)
This one sounds pretty simple but can easily happen. People sometimes get caught up in what they want doing. They may call in a handyman to change their taps but then ask for sperate quotes on changing taps, changing taps + tiling a splashback, changing the sink, changing the sink and retiling the bathroom, changing the whole suite and a retile, retiling the whole bathroom in slate, retiling the whole bathroom in porcelain. From the handyman’s point of view, preparing 7-8 individual quotes for a job which will most likely end up and changing a tap (the first job called in for) is quite nonsensical. 7-8 quotes will take an hour, this time will have to be made up on the job so the quote will be high.
To avoid spending this money unnecessarily,decide on what you want doing, or a choice of two options and discuss it with your handyman.
Keep your appointment
We are happy to see customer’s jobs most evenings and at weekends but please, if you make an appointment, don’t ring at the appointment time and tell us you’ll be half an hour late.
Tidy the area, room, house
This is something we don’t mind doing but can save you money if you do it yourself. We recently decorated a whole house and the cost could have been halved if we didn’t have to tidy up each room , move furniture, then vacuum before starting the job.

Handyman Services|Permalink|Comments Offon Saving Money with your Manchester Handyman|  Posted February 9, 2010 by  admin
Once you’ve found him you’ll want to keep him. With all the stories from friends, family and programmes on the television such as Watchdog and Cowboy builders you should know just how few and far between honest, reliable and professional tradesmen are. Thos e which won’t create extra work, charge by the hour then work like a sloth and even break things further to increase their income. These cowboy tradesmen are all over the UK and ever more prevalent in the Handyman sector.
Unlike a plasterer, a plumber, or even a locksmith, a handyman doesn’t have to be time-served or learn a trade, they don’t have to qualify or pass any exams and as such a lot of people turn their hand to it, even though they may not be very good. Cheap entry such as a few tools and an advert in the newspaper means they can get work straight away and put their few ‘skills’ they have learnt from watching 60 minute makeover to good use.
Now, here at Handyman Manchester, we are all for free enterprise and people using their initiative but we also believe that whatever services someone offers, advertises or promotes, they should be able to carry out competently, to a high standard and be adequately insured for the work they are undertaking. Insurance for handyman businesses is available from as little as £60 a year, this is a minimum outlay and provides you, the customer, with peace of mind that if anything does go wrong, they you can claim to get it put right. If your handyman isn’t even willing to invest £60 in their business then you should be asking yourself how much time and effort they are spending on the jobs you are paying them to do.
Standing out as a Great Handyman
Any handyman worth their salt will have public liability insurance as a minimum, ask to see their policy certificate and check it is date. What other things should you look out for?
Portfolio – A conscientious Handyman should have a portfolio full of before and after pictures of work they have carried out. They should show you projects similar to yours they have worked on before.
Testimonials – Happy customers are a great sign of a good handyman. Handwritten testimonials will give you an insight into how the chap works, how he treats his customers and how happy they were with the jobs carried out.
Helping your Handyman
Once you have found a handyman who has done a great job and you are happy with it is now your turn to repay the favour. With advertising becoming more and more expensive and more people competing for handyman work a recommendation can go a long way. Recommending your handyman to friends, family and work colleagues will help the handyman to keep busy and your acquaintances to be safe in the knowledge they are using someone reputable. I’m sure your handyman will be so pleased that they give you a discount on your next job, I know Handyman Manchester does.

Painting and decorating any room can give a complete change of mood. It can create many different looks and change how the room makes you feel. The choice of colour can determine your attitude and give the impression of a larger or smaller space. This is all well and good, but there may be a few underlying issues which you haven’t yet thought about, which maybe you should.
We have been decorating for many years and we see the same thing repeating itself with many decorating jobs. Sometimes you want to change more than just painting and decorating. This is handyman manchesters realm….

Hello and welcome to our painting and decorating services section! Now we shall assume that you are here because you have either bought a brand spanking new house that you want decorating, that you’ve suddenly realised that your home was outdated 25 years ago and desperately needs a decoration overhaul or you’ve a huge commercial office that needs a spruce up to get it looking dapper? Well you’re in luck because we just happen to be one of the best (probably!) painters and decorators in the Manchester area – not that we’re fond of blowing our own trumpet! We can tackle any decorating job you care to throw at us; from livening up small family homes to large city centre offices. No commercial or domestic painting and decorating job is too big or too large for our team of super decorators!
We operate in and around the Manchester area, so if you live a little further out just give us a call and we’ll do our best to get to you. Our reputation is growing fast within the Greater Manchester area so we are used to travelling a little further afield for clients!
Not only are we friendly and helpful, but we have years of experience and offer a professional, guaranteed, top notch service that you’ll be recommending to friends and family. In fact it’s through recommendations that we get most of our business, which says a lot about the type of decorating service we offer.
So what will we do? Well really you should be asking what we don’t do! Here are just a few of the services we cover:
Our creative streak means that we take a real pride in our work and can offer you advice and inspiration on themes and decor for your home. Our painters are artists when it comes to feature walls and can create children’s room themes, wall characters and stunning designs that will bring your room to life!
One thing we won’t do is to charge you for any advice, consultation or estimates. We understand that deciding on the right decor for your home takes time and so we are more than happy to leave the information with you and give you time to plan your dream home or office.
If you have a job that requires plastering and are looking for a professional plasterer, then see ourPlastering Page.

We don’t just want to provide an adequate painting and decorating service, we want to go above and beyond your expectations – after all our business depends on recommendations from happy customers! Our professionalism shines through everything we do, from the day we enter until the day we leave.

Well, we’ve always offered it, but thought it was about time we put it on our website.
Handyman Manchester now offersTV Wall Mountinganywhere in the Greater Manchester area.
We thought with Christmas rapidly approaching and TVs being quite a popular present that we would let everyone we know we are able to wall mount any size or brand of television on most types of wall, whether brick, block or stud.
Book us in today and we’ll make sure you don’t miss out on your festive viewing.
Have a great Christmas
